\title{Notes on the Schur-Weyl Functor \vspace{-1ex}}
\author{Nico Courts}
\date{Summer 2019}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	These notes are my summary of the development of the Schur-Weyl functor from representations of the Schur algebra $S(n,d)$ to 
	representations of $\frakS_d$. After developing the theory that arose beginning in Schur's 1901 thesis, we will establish that this 
	functor is exact and behaves nicely with respect to simple modules, as well as being a monoidal functor (under the correct monoidal structure).
\end{abstract}

\section{Background and Introduction}
The primary reference for this paper is J.A. Green's \textit{Polynomial Representations of $\GL_n$} \cite{green}. Other sources will be used as well, 
and will be introduced as needed.

The basic idea for this theory begins with Schur's thesis in 1901 \cite{schur-thesis}. Here he developed the theory underlying
the representation theory of the general linear group $\GL_n$. As a tool, he recognized that the irreducible representations of 
$\GL_n$ took on a particular form that made them amenable to admitting actions by symmetric groups. Then Schur could rely on 
Frobenius' development of the representation theory for $\frakS_d$ to say something about $\GL_n$.

\subsection{Notation}
We always use $\frakS_d$ to denote the symmetric group on $d$ letters, and let $k$ be an infinite field (unless otherwise noted).

\subsection{Representations of Semigroups}
Recall that a \textbf{semigroup} is a group where we relax the inverse requirement. If we are interested in studying the representation 
theory of a semigroup $\Gamma$, there are some natural modules to consider:
\begin{ex}
	$k\Gamma=\bigoplus_{g\in \Gamma}kg$, the \textbf{semigroup algebra} for $\Gamma$ over $k$. Notice that if $\Gamma$ is infinite, we only take 
	the elements that are supported at finitely many $g$ (that is, only finitely many coefficients are nonzero).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}\label{ex:bimod} $k^\Gamma$, the set of all maps $\Gamma\to k$, which is naturally a commutative $k$-algebra. It inherits a $k\Gamma$-bimodule structure 
	by considering the left- and right-translation maps $L_g:k^\Gamma\to k$ and $R_g:k^\Gamma\to k$ defined for all $g\in\Gamma$ by 
	\[L_g(f)(h)= f(gh)\qquad R_g(f)(h)=f(hg)\]
	Due to the fact that $L_g$ defines the \textit{right} action and $R_g$ the left, we write for simplicity:
	\[g\circ f=R_g(f)\quad\text{and}\quad f\circ g=L_g(f).\]
\end{ex}

It is in the context of the $k\Gamma$ module $k^\Gamma$ that we get our first definition:
\begin{defn}\label{defn-finitary}
	Let $k^\Gamma$ be as above. Then an element $f:\Gamma\to k$ is called a \textbf{finitary element} or \textbf{representative function}
	if $f$ satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $k^\Gamma f$ is finite dimensional over $k$.
		\item $f k^\Gamma$ is finite dimensional over $k$.
		\item $\Delta f\in k^\Gamma\otimes k^\Gamma$ -- in other words, the comultiplication $\Delta f$ is finitely supported.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
	The collection of all finitary elements of $k^\Gamma$ will be written $F=F(k^\Gamma)$ and is a $k$-bialgebra -- in particular,
	a sub-bialgebra of $k^\Gamma$.
\end{rmk}
\begin{rmk}
	The reason such elements are called representative functions is that if we fix a finite dimensional $V$ over $k$ 
	and a basis $\calB$ for $V$, we can write down the structure maps of a particular $\Gamma$ action by noticing 
	\[g\cdot \alpha=\sum_{\beta\in\calB}r_{\alpha\beta}(g)\beta\]
	where $r_{\alpha\beta}:\Gamma\to k$ are called the \textbf{coefficient functions} of the representation.

	Then the $k$-span $\operatorname{cf}(V)=\sum_{\alpha,\beta}k\cdot r_{\alpha\beta}$ of coefficient functions for a particular (finite-dimensional) representation 
	$V$ ends up being a subcoalgebra of $k^\Gamma$ and in fact every finitary function lies in $\operatorname{cf}(V)$ for some 
	finite-dimensional $V$. Here we can just take $V=k^\Gamma f$ which is finite dimensional by defn~\ref{defn-finitary}.
\end{rmk}

An important idea that comes from this that one can define an \textbf{algebraic representation theory} of $\Gamma$ over $k$. Take any subcoalgebra $A$ of $F=F(k^\Gamma)$
and define the $A$\textbf{-representation theory} of $\Gamma$ to be the full subcategory $\mathbf{mod}_A(k\Gamma)$ of $\rmod (k\Gamma)$ to be the one whose 
objects are the (finite-dimensional) $k\Gamma$ modules $V$ such that $\text{cf}(V)\subseteq A$.

A nice result is that the (left) $A$-rational $k\Gamma$-modules are equivalent to the category $\mathbf{com}(A)$ of finite (right) $A$-comodules.
\begin{prop}\label{prop-modcomod}
	$\mathbf{mod}_A(k\Gamma)\simeq \mathbf{com}(A)$
\end{prop}
\begin{prf}
	\textit{Sketch:} Take an $A$-rational $k\Gamma$ module $V$ with action $\tau:\Gamma\to V$. Fix a basis $\{v_i\}_1^n$
	and as before extract the structure maps $r_{\alpha\beta}$:
	\[\tau(v_\alpha)=\sum_\beta r_{\alpha\beta} v_\beta.\]
	
	Then define the comodule $(V,\gamma)$ with coaction $\gamma$ via 
	\[\gamma(v_\alpha)=\sum_\beta v_\beta\otimes r_{\alpha\beta}.\]
	One can check this defines a comodule structure on $V$. 

	The process reverses very easily, where one extracts the $r_{\alpha\beta}$ from the coaction.
	By construction we will have that $r_{\alpha\beta}\in A$, so we get the $A$-rationality for free.

	Some mopping up shows that these are equivalences of categories, which is pretty believable. 
\end{prf}	
\begin{rmk}
	One of the most immediate consequences of this realization (it is barely a proof) is that we can define a left $A^\ast=\Hom_k(A,k)$-module (note that $A^\ast$ is a $k$-algebra with the convolution product)
	structure on any right $A$-comodule. We do this by writing for any $f\in A^\ast$
	\[f\cdot v=(\1_V\otimes f)(\gamma(v))\]
	or in coordinates 
	\[f\cdot v_\alpha=\sum_\beta f(r_{\alpha\beta})v_\beta\]
\end{rmk}

\section{Polynomial representations of \texorpdfstring{$\GL_n$}{GLn} and the Schur Algebra}
From now on, we specialize the theory in the section above to the case when $\Gamma=\GL_n$ (we can think of this as the group scheme). 

\subsection{Generators and Bases}
There are very natural choices of generators (as (co)algebras and as $k$ spaces). Starting off, we can define
\[A_k(n)\cong k[\omega_{ij}]\]
for $1\le i,j\le n$, where we can think of $\omega_{ij}:\Gamma\to k$ as the map that ``extracts'' from $g\in\Gamma$ the $(i,j)^{th}$ entry.

Then $A_k(n)$ is the set of \textbf{polynomial maps} $\Gamma\to k$. Then we define $A_k(n,r)$ to be the $k$-space spanned by all homogeneous degree $r$ 
polynomials in $A_k(n)$. A stars-and-bars argument gets us that there are $\binom{n^2+r-1}{r}$ ways to choose a monomial of degree $r$ from among the $n^2$ generators,
so this gives us the dimension of $A_k(n,d)$.

\subsection{Index Notation}
\label{subsec:index}
We need to use multi-indicies to rigorously discuss monomials so let $I(n,r)$ denote the set of length $r$ multi-indices drawn from $\underline n$. Then 
we can impose the equivalence relation: if $\alpha,\beta\in I(n,r)$,
\[\alpha\sim\beta \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \alpha=(n_{i_1},\dots,n_{i_r})\text{ and } \beta=(n_{i_{\sigma(1)}},\dots, n_{i_{\sigma(r)}})\]
for some $\sigma\in\frakS_r$. That is, two multi-indices are equivalent if they contain the same indicies with the same multiplicities. Sometimes it is useful to think 
of this as a group action of $\frakS_r$ on $I(n,r)$, and we say two elements are equivalent if they are in the same orbit.

Extend this group action (and thus relation) to $I(n,r)\times I(n,r)$ where $G$ acts diagonally:
\[g\cdot(i,j)=(g\cdot i,g\cdot j).\]

\subsection{Module Categories}
The module categories\footnote{Equivalently the appropriate comodule categories in light of prop.~\ref{prop-modcomod}} $\mathbf{mod}_{A}(k\Gamma)$ of 
(homogeneous degree $r$) polynomial representations of $\GL_n(k)$ (when $A=A_k(n,r)$ and $A=A_k(n)$ respectively) are precisely what you'd think. We will sometimes 
use the notation $M_k(n)$ and $M_k(n,r)$ following the text.

One of the big realizations of Schur's was that any polynomial representation of $\GL_n$ splits into a direct sum of homogeneous polynomial representations:
\begin{thm}[{\cite[p.5]{schur-thesis}}]
	Let $V\in M_k(n)$. Then 
	\[V\cong \bigoplus_{r\ge 0} V_r\]
	where $V_r\in M_k(n,r)$ for all $r$.
\end{thm}
\begin{cor}
	The indecomposable modules in $M_k(n)$ are all in $M_k(n,r)$ for some $r$.
\end{cor}

But then if we are interested in the structure of polynomial representations of $\Gamma$, we can restrict our attention entirely to the homogeneous modules
of any particular degree. The upshot here is that $A_k(n,r)$ is finite dimensional, so very computationally amenable.

\subsection{The Schur Algebra}
\begin{defn}
	The \textbf{Schur algebra} $S_k(n,d)$ is the dual of $A=A_k(n,d):$
	\[S_k(n,d)=A^\ast=\Hom_k(A(n,d),k).\]
\end{defn}

We can write down an explicit basis for $S_k(n,r)$ as a dual basis for the basis $\{c_{ij}|i,j\in I(n,r)\}$ for $A_k(n,r)$. We denote this basis $\xi_{ij}$, where 
\[\xi_{ij}(c_{kl})=\begin{cases}
	1,& (i,j)\sim (k,l)\\
	0,&\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]
and we can define multiplication via the coproduct $\Delta$ on $A_k(s,r)$:
\[\xi\eta(c)=\sum \xi(c_{(1)})\eta(c_{(2)})\]
where we recall that $\Delta(c_{ij})=\sum_k c_{ik}\otimes c_{kj}$ and $\varepsilon(c)=c(I_n)$ are the coalgebra structure inherited on $A_k(n,r)$ 
from $A_k(n)$ and thus from $k^\Gamma$.

\begin{prop}
	The product of two basis elements in $S_k(n,r)$ is given by 
	\[\xi_{ab}\xi_{cd}=\sum_{(p,q)\in I(n,r)^2}Z_{a,b,c,d,p,q}\xi_{pq}\]
	where 
	\[Z_{a,b,c,d,p,q}=\#\{s\in I(n,r)|(a,b)\sim(p,s)\text{ and }(c,d)\sim(s,q)\}\]
\end{prop}
\begin{cor}
	$\xi_{ab}\xi_{cd}=0$ if $b\not\sim c$.
\end{cor}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:idempotent}
	$\xi_{ab}\xi_{bb}=\xi_{ab}=\xi_{aa}\xi_{ab}$.
\end{cor}

The last thing here is to notice that $\varepsilon=\sum_{I(n,r)^2}\xi_{ab}$ where equality can be seen by evaluating at the basis $c_{ab}$ of $A_k(n,r)$.

\subsection{The Evaluation Map}
There is a natural map $e:k\Gamma\to S_k(n,r)$ defined in the following way: if $f\in A_k(n,r)\subset k^\Gamma$ (which can be uniquely extended $k$-linearly 
to a map on $k\Gamma$),
\[e(\kappa)(f)=f(\kappa)\]
where $\kappa\in k\Gamma$.

The use of this map is that (since it can be shown to be surjective and that things in the kernel of this map must act by zero on $M_k(n,r)$), that the category
of $S_k(n,r)$ modules and the category of $A_k(n,r)$-rational $k\Gamma$ representations are equivalent. The evaluation map gives us a direct translation between 
the two actions: $\kappa\cdot v=e(\kappa)\cdot v$ and if $k\Gamma$ acts on $V$ with structure maps $(r_{ab})$, then for $\xi\in S_k(n,r)$,
\[\xi\cdot v_b=\sum_a \xi(r_{ab})v_a\]

\subsection{Modular Theory}
We can extract the $\bbZ$ forms $A_\bbZ(n)$ and $A_\bbZ(n,r)$ as the $\bbZ$ span of the basis elements $c_{ij}^\bbQ$ (the basis with respect to $k=\bbQ$). These 
are closed under $\Delta$ and have the further property that for instance $\varepsilon(A_\bbZ(n,r))\subseteq\bbZ$.

Then we can extend scalars in the way we'd like: there is a $k$-colagebra isomorphism 
\[A_\bbZ(n,r)\otimes_\bbZ k\cong A_k(n,r),\] 
so we can recover the larger algebra from this $\bbZ$-form. But this actually transfers to the Schur algebra as well!

Define $S_\bbZ(n,r)$ to be the collection of $\xi\in S_\bbQ(n,r)$ such that $\xi(A_\bbZ(n,r))\subseteq\bbZ$. Then we get a $k$-algebra isomorphism
\[S_\bbZ(n,r)\otimes_\bbZ k\cong S_k(n,r).\]
This gives us a $\bbZ$-form for the scheme $S(n,r)$ -- or that ``the Schur scheme is defined over $\bbZ$.''

We can also define a $\bbZ$-form of a ($A_\bbQ(n,r)$-rational) $\bbQ\Gamma$-module $V$ to be denoted $V_\bbZ$ and to be the $\bbZ$-span of a $\bbQ$-basis for $V$
and to furthermore be closed under the $S_\bbZ(n,r)$-action (leveraging the equivalence of categories in the previous section).

This process of generating $V_k$ modules by extending scalars from a $\bbZ$-form is called \textbf{modular reduction}, and has a small caveat:
the $\bbZ$-form we pick needn't be unique and, in general, using different $\bbZ$-forms will yield non-isomorphic extensions to $k$-modules. The upshot here,
following the theory developed in \cite{brauer} and \cite{green-locFinReps}, is that the multiplicity with which simple modules occur in a composition series of $V_k$
are not dependent on the choice of $\bbZ$-form.

\subsection{The Trick}
To do some magic we notice that there is a duality at play between the $A_k(n,r)$-regular representations of $\GL_n$ and the representations of $\frakS_r$, 
and to see this we consider the natural action of these groups on $E^{\otimes r}$, where $E\cong k^n$. The left action by $\Gamma$ is just the diagonal action 
on each $k^n$ and $\frakS_r$ acts on $E^{\otimes r}$ on the right by permuting the tensor factors. The critical thing to notice here is that these two 
actions commute with one another:
\[(g\cdot v)\cdot\sigma=g\cdot(v\cdot\sigma),\ \forall g\in\Gamma, \sigma\in\frakS_r.\]

Then we get some results from Schur's 1927 paper \textit{\"Uber the rationalen Darstellungen der allgemeinen linearen Gruppe}, a reference to which I am yet to cook up.
\begin{thm}[Schur]
	Let $\varphi:S_k(n,r)\to \End_k(E^{\otimes r})$ be the representation afforded by the above action of $S_k(n,r)$. Then 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\Im \varphi=\End_{k\frakS_r}(E^{\otimes r})$; and 
		\item $\ker\varphi=0$.
	\end{itemize}
	So $S_k(n,r)\cong \End_{k\frakS_r}(E^{\otimes r})$.
\end{thm}
The idea here is to take our $\xi_{ab}$ basis for $S_k(n,r)$ and determine where the images go. Not too hard, I think.
\begin{cor}[Schur]
	If $\ch k=0$ or $\ch k>r$, then $S_k(n,r)$ is semisimple. That is every element of $M_k(n,r)$ is completely reducible.
\end{cor}
To see this, we just use the fact that $k\frakS_r$ is semisimple as in usual representation theory. Thus $E^{\otimes r}$ is 
completely reducible, but the endomorphism ring of a completely reducible module is semisimple, so by the above theorem, $S_k(n,r)$ is semisimple.

\subsection{Back to \texorpdfstring{$\bbZ$}{Z}-forms}
In fact, $E^{\otimes r}$ is a $\GL_n$-module (this time regarded as an affine group scheme over $\bbZ$). Let $\{V_k\}$ be a collection 
of $k$-modules for each $k$ in some family of infinite fields. Then we say $\{V_k\}$ is \textbf{defined over $\bbZ$} if there is a $\bbZ$-form $V_\bbZ$
and a family of isomorphisms $\delta_k:V_\bbZ\otimes k\to V_k$.

In particular, the family of modules $E^{\otimes r}_k$ is defined over $\bbZ$.

\subsection{Contravariant Duality}\label{subsec:contra}
In group theory a usual way to define a dual representation for a $k\Gamma$-module $V$ is to take the linear 
dual $V^\ast=\Hom_k(V,k)$ and define a left action of $\Gamma$ by 
\[g\cdot f(v)=f(g^{-1}v)\]
which give you another (left) $k\Gamma$-module. The problem with this process in our case is that the resulting 
module may have structure maps $r_{ab}$ that no longer lie in $A_k(n,r)$. To account for this, we instead define the 
\textbf{contravariant dual} $V^\circ$, defined using the transpose:
\[g\cdot f=f(g^{\text{tr}}v).\]

It is clear that the map $J:S_k(n,r)\to S_k(n,r)$ sending $\xi_{ab}$ to $\xi_{ba}$ is an involutory antihomomorphism.
Notice 
\[J(\xi)(c_{ab})=\xi(c_{ba})\]
and so by taking $\xi=e_g$, we get 
\[J(e_g)(c_{ab})=e_g(c_{ba})=c_{ba}(g)=c_{ab}(g^{\text{tr}})\]
so $J(e_g)=e_{g^{\text{tr}}}$.

So given an $A_k(n,r)$-rational $k\Gamma$ representation $V$, the corresponding $S_k(n,r)$ action on $V^\circ$ is given by 
\[\xi\cdot f (v)=f(J(\xi)v).\]

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$A_k(n,r)$}{Ak(n,r)} as a \texorpdfstring{$k\Gamma$}{kGamma}-module}
Recall from example~\ref{ex:bimod} the left and right actions by $k\Gamma$ we put on $k^\Gamma$. The coproduct $\Delta$ on $k^\Gamma$
defining multiplication in the usual way, that is
\[\left(\sum_h f_h\otimes f_h'\right)(s,t)=\Delta(f)(s,t)=f(st)\]
gives us a convenient way to write, for any $c\in A_k(n,r)$, (since $R_tc(g)=c(gt)=\sum_h f_h(g)\otimes f_h'(t)=L_g c(t)$)
\[t\circ c= R_t c=\Delta(c)(-,t)=\sum_h f_h(-)f_h'(t)=\sum_h f'_h(t)f_h\]
and similarly
\[c\circ t=\sum_h f_h(t)f'_h.\]
These can be extended linearly from $t\in\Gamma$ to $k\Gamma$, giving us (commuting) left and right actions on $A_k(n,r)$.

Then some results in the book show that these actions on $A_k(n,r)$ by $k^\Gamma$ descends to ones by $A_k(n,r)$ itself, 
and thus becomes an $A_k(n,r)$- and thus $S_k(n,r)$-bimodule.

Of course this gives us a $k\Gamma$-bimodule structure on $S_k(n,r)$ as well, and then using the following:
\begin{thm}\label{thm:bil-forms}
	Contravariant bilinear forms $(\cdot,\cdot):V\times W\to k$ where by contravariant we mean, for all $\xi\in S_k(n,r)$,
	\[(\xi\cdot v,w)=(v,J(\xi)\cdot w)\]
	are in bijection with linear maps $\Lambda:V\to W^\circ$ via the relation 
	\[\Lambda(v)(w)=(v,w).\]
	Furthermore $\Lambda$ is an isomorphism if and only if its corresponding form under this bijection is non-degenerate.
\end{thm}
Then by letting $(\cdot,\cdot):S_k(n,r)\times A_k(n,r)\to k$ (a form on $S_k(n,r)$-modules!) be the form given by 
\[(\xi, c)=J(\xi)(c)\]
one can check that this is indeed bilinear and contravariant, and furthermore non-degenerate, giving us an isomorphism 
\begin{cor}
	\[A_k(n,r)\cong S_k(n,r)^\circ\]
	as $k\Gamma$-bimodules.
\end{cor}
\begin{rmk}
	The book is a bit scant on details, but I believe the idea here is that this whole thing can be done in $M'_k(n,r)$, the 
	category of \textit{right} $S_k(n,r)$-modules, giving us a bimodule (instead of right module) isomorphism.
\end{rmk}

\section{Weights and Characters}
The structure theory of representation category $M_k(n,r)$ closely resembles the theory of weights that arises in the study of 
semisimple Lie algebras. The standard reference is \cite{humphreys-liereps}, however I have recently been enjoying Fulton \& Harris' 
lovely set of lectures in \cite{fulton-harris}. I am going to take some time to make sure I understand their treatment before diving into this fully.

\begin{defn}
	Let $\Lambda(n,r)$ be the $\frakS_r$ orbit space of $I(n,r)$ (cf. subsection~\ref{subsec:index}). This is called the (dimension $r$)
	collection of \textbf{weights of $\GL_n$}.

	Notice that these should be thought of a monomials in the polynomial algebra on $n$ indeterminates.
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
	Notice that each element $\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)$ can be represented as an $n$-tuple where $\alpha_i$ is the number of times 
	that $i$ appears in any multi-index in $\alpha$. This is essentially the multi-degree.
\end{rmk}

Then we can identify $\frakS_n=W$ as the Weyl group of $\GL_n$. This acts on the left of $I(n,r)$ not by simply permuting labels, but by applying 
a permutation from the bigger $\frakS_n$:
\[\sigma\cdot(i_1,\dots,i_r)=(\sigma(i_1),\dots,\sigma(i_r)).\]
This action commutes with the right action of $\frakS_r$, so this action we just defined descends to one on $\Lambda(n,r)$.
\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{dominant weight} is a weight $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_r)\in\Lambda(n,r)$ such that 
	\[\lambda_1\ge\cdots\ge\lambda_r.\]
	Denote the set of all dominant weights in $\Lambda(n,r)$ as $\Lambda^+(n,r)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
	Notice that each $W$-orbit in $\Lambda(n,r)$ has a unique dominant weight (although it may be achieved multiple times).
\end{rmk}
\begin{rmk}
	Elements in $\Lambda^+(n,r)$ correspond bijectively to partions of $r$ into not more than $n$ parts.
\end{rmk}
\subsection{Weight Spaces}
Now notice that corollary~\ref{cor:idempotent} gave us that $\xi_{ii}^2=\xi_{ii}$ and the corollary before gave us $\xi_{ii}\xi_{jj}=\delta_{ij}$. Then the correspondence between $A_k(n,r)$-rational 
representations and $S_k(n,r)$ modules gives us that (for $V\in M_k(n,r)$):
\[\varepsilon(v)=e(1_\Gamma)(v)=1_\Gamma\cdot v=v\]
and the decomposition\footnote{Note that here we are using that $\xi_{ii}=\xi_{jj}$ if and only if $i\sim j$, so we can represent $\xi_{ii}$ 
by orbit $\alpha$ of $i$ under $\frakS_r$.} $\varepsilon=\sum_{\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)}\xi_\alpha$,
\[V=\varepsilon(V)=\sum_{\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)}\xi_{\alpha}V\]
giving us our decomposition into weight spaces. To see{ this we show that 
\[\xi_\alpha V= V^\alpha=\{v\in V|x(t)v=t_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots t_n^{\alpha_n}v,\; \forall x(t)\in T_n(k)\}\]
where $T_n(k)$ is the maximal split torus consisting of diagonal matrices in $\GL_n(k)$. Here the notation is that 
\[x(t)=\operatorname{diag}(t_1,\dots,t_n).\]
\begin{rmk}
	Define the character $\chi^\alpha:T_n(k)\to k$ via 
	\[\chi^\alpha(x(t))=t_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots t_n^{\alpha_n}\]
\end{rmk}
Then we have the result 
\begin{prop}
	\[\xi_\alpha V= V^\alpha\]
\end{prop}
\begin{prf}
	To see this, we begin by computing the image of $c_{i,j}$ under the image of $e_{x(t)}$ and $\sum_{\alpha}\chi^\alpha(x(t))\xi_\alpha$:
	\[e_{x(t)}(c_{i,j})=\prod_k c_{i_kj_k}(e_{x(t)})\]
	which is zero unless $i_k=j_k$ for all $k$--in other words, if $i=j$. Then in this case, 
	\[e_{x(t)}(c_{i,i})=\chi^\alpha(x(t))\]
	where $\alpha$ is the weight associated to $i$.

	Computing from the other end, $\xi_\alpha(c_{ij})=0$ unless $\alpha$ is the weight of $i$ and 
	$j=i$. If $i=j$, a single term is nonzero--the summand corresponding to $\alpha$, the weight of $i$, giving us $\chi^\alpha(x(t))$.

	Since the $S_k(n,r)$ action via $e_{x(t)}$ corresponds to the $\GL_n$ action via $x(t)$. Then take any element $w\in\xi_\alpha V$ and using that the 
	$\xi_{i,i}$ are orthogonal idempotents, we can compute the action of $T_k(n)$ on $\xi_\alpha V$:
	\[x(t)\cdot v=e_{x(t)}v=t_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots t_n^{\alpha_n} v\]
	so $v\in V^\alpha$.

	Now if $v\in V^\alpha\cap V^\beta$, consider the action by $A=\operatorname{diag}(2,1,1,\dots,1)$. Then since 
	\[A\cdot v=2^{\alpha_1}v=2^{\beta_1}v\]
	this forces $\alpha_1=\beta_1$ and similar arguments show that $\alpha=\beta$. Thus the sum of $V^\alpha$'s are direct and since their sum is all of $V$ (since their sum 
	contains the sum of the $\xi_\alpha V$), we get that these summands are precisely the $\xi_\alpha V$.
\end{prf}
\begin{rmk}
	A very useful consequence here is that we have a subalgebra $D_k(n,r)\subseteq S_k(n,r)$ spanned over $k$ by the $\xi_\alpha$ for $\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)$
	This is the image of $T_k(n)$ under the evaluation map $e$.
\end{rmk}

Another useful fact: the weight spaces $V^\alpha$ are stable under the $\frakS_n$ action (up to isomorphism).
\begin{prop}\label{prop:dom-weight-dimension}
	Let $\omega\in\frakS_n$. Then 
	\[V^\alpha\cong V^{\omega(\alpha)}.\]
\end{prop}
\begin{prf}
	The proof of this boils down to noticing that the action of $\GL_n$ on $V^{\omega(\alpha)}$ is the same of a translated 
	version of $\GL_n$. Specifically, let $\eta_\omega$ be the permutation matrix taking the standard basis to $\{e_{\omega(1)},\dots,e_{\omega(n)}\}$.
	Then 
	\[x(t_{\omega(1)},\dots,t_{\omega(n)})=\eta_\omega^{-1}x(t_1,\dots,t_n)\]
	so application of $n_\omega$ yields an isomorphism from $V^\alpha$ to $V^{\omega(\alpha)}$.
\end{prf}
The restriction to the $\alpha$-weight elements is an exact functor!
\begin{prop}\label{prop:xi-exact}
	If 
	\[0\to A\to B\to C\to 0\]
	is a short exact sequence of elements in $M_k(n,r)$, then so is 
	\[0\to A^\alpha\to B^\alpha\to C^\alpha\to 0\]
	for all $\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{prf}
	Left exactness is immediate since this functor acts on morphisms by restriction to a subspace. Right exactness follows since for 
	any $\xi_\alpha c\in\xi_\alpha C$, since the map $g:B\to C$ is surjective, there is a $b\in B$ mapping to $c$. But then 
	$\xi_\alpha b\in\xi_\alpha B$ and its image is 
	\[g(\xi_\alpha b)=\xi_\alpha g(b)=(\xi_\alpha)^2c=\xi_\alpha c\]
	since $\xi_\alpha$ is idempotent.
\end{prf}

\subsubsection{Extending Scalars}\label{subsubsec:extending}
Notice that a simple computation using linear algebra and counting degrees gets us that 
for any $V\in M_k(n,r)$ and $W\in M_k(n,s)$, we can define the module $V\otimes W\in M_k(n,r+s)$ 
where if $\gamma\in \Lambda(n,r+s),$ the weight spaces are
\[(V\otimes W)^\gamma=\bigoplus_{\alpha,\beta}V^\alpha\otimes W^\beta\]
where the sum is over all $\alpha$ and $\beta$ whose sum is $\gamma$.

Notice that we can identify each $\xi_{i,j}\in S_k(n,r)$ with $\xi_{i,j}^L$ in any field extension $L$ of $k$. 
In this way, we can embed $S_k(n,r)$ in $S_L(n,r)$. But then if we let $V_L=V\otimes_k L$ for any $V\in M_k(n,r)$, we extend scalars in the obvious way:
\[\left(\sum l_{i,j}\xi_{i,j}\right)(v\otimes a)=\sum \xi_{i,j}(v)\otimes l_{i,j}\cdot a\]
to make $V_L$ into an $S_L(n,r)$-module. But then just by degree considerations we have
\begin{prop}
	The weight space $V_L^\alpha$ is the $L$ span of $V^\alpha$. Thus $\dim_k V^\alpha=\dim_L V_L^\alpha$.
\end{prop}

\subsubsection{Contravariant Duals}

Our discussion of contravariant duality in section~\ref{subsec:contra} continues in terms of these weight modules:

Notice that if $(,)$ is a contravariant pairing of $V$ and $W$, then since $J(\xi_\alpha)=\xi_\alpha$, we get 
\[(\xi_\alpha v,\xi_\beta w)=(v,J(\xi_\alpha)\xi_\beta w)=(v,\xi_\alpha\xi_\beta w)\]
which is zero unless $\alpha=\beta$.

Therefore having a nondegenerate contravariant pairing is equivalent to there being a pairing that is nondegenerate 
when restricted to $V^\alpha\times W^\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in\Lambda(n,r)$.

So in particular if $W=V^\circ$, there is an isomorphism $V\to V^\circ$ sending each element to its dual,
so we know there is a nondegenerate contravariant pairing by theorem~\ref{thm:bil-forms}. 
This implies that we get a map $V^\alpha\to (V^\circ)^\alpha$ and since the pairing is still nondegenerate upon restricting to $V^\alpha$, this is an isomorphism. In particular,
\[\dim V^\alpha=\dim (V^\circ)^\alpha\]

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{$\bbZ$}{Z}-defined Families}
Let $\{V_k\}$ be a family defined over $\bbZ$ by $V_\bbZ$ and isomorphisms $\delta_k:V_\bbZ\otimes k\to V_k$. Then since we can consider $\xi_\alpha^\bbQ$ 
to be the same functional as $\xi_\alpha^\bbZ$ defined over $\bbZ$, we get 
\[V_\bbZ=\bigoplus \xi_\alpha^\bbQ V_\bbZ=\bigoplus V_\bbZ\cap V_\bbQ^\alpha\]
and using the discussion in \ref{subsubsec:extending}, we get 
\begin{prop}
	For each $V_k$, a module defined over $\bbZ$ by $V_\bbZ$ and $\delta:V_\bbZ\otimes k\to V_k$,
	$V_k^\alpha$ is the $k$-span of the image of $\xi_\alpha^\bbQ V_\bbZ\otimes 1_k$ under $\delta$.
\end{prop}
\begin{rmk}
	As the summand of a free $\bbZ$-module, $\xi_\alpha^Q V_\bbZ$ is projective whence free (as a $\bbZ$-module). Thus if $r=\rank \xi_\bbQ^\alpha V_\bbZ$, 
	then $\dim_\bbQ V_\bbQ^\alpha=r=\dim_k V_k^\alpha$.
\end{rmk}

\subsection{Characters}
The theory of characters comes into play as always in representation theory, but here we see a slight distinction:
we define \textit{formal characters} on $n$ intederminates to stand in for the traditional characters.

Recall that in standard representation theory, the \textbf{(natural) character} of a representation $(V,\rho)$ over $k$ of a group $\Gamma$ is a map 
\[\varphi_V:\Gamma\to k\]
defined element-wise by 
\[\varphi_V(g)=\tr \rho(g).\]
The problem with this approach is that we want to define the character in terms of \textit{eigenvalues} of a given matrix, 
but we don't necessarily have access to these eigenvalues over an arbitrary field $k$. For this reason, we define 
the formal character of an element below and then show that after passing to an appropriate extension of $k$ (e.g. the algebraic closure)
the natural character at $g$ coincides with evaluating the formal character at the eigenvalues of the matrix $\rho(g)$.

\subsubsection{Formal Characters}
Let $V\in M_k(n,r)$. Then we write 
\[\Phi_V(X_1,\dots, X_n)=\sum_{\alpha\in\Lambda_k(n,r)}(\dim_k V^\alpha) \ X_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots X_n^{\alpha_n}\]
or by leveraging the monomial basis for symmetric functions (this function is symmetric using proposition~\ref{prop:dom-weight-dimension}):
\[\Phi_V(X_i)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda^+_k(n,r)}(\dim_kV^\lambda)\ m_\lambda(X_1,\dots,X_n)\]

Now by proposition~\ref{prop:xi-exact}, we can quickly see that if the following is exact:
\[0\to V_1\to V\to V_2\to 0\]
the character of $V$ is 
\[\Phi_{V}=\Phi_{V_1}+\Phi_{V_2}=\Phi_{V_1}+\Phi_{V/V_1}\]
and by induction, given any composition series 
\[V=V_0\supset V_1\supset\cdots V_l=0\]
the character of $V$ can be computed via its composition factors \`a la Jordan-H\"older:
\[\Phi_V=\sum_{i=1}^l \Phi_{V_{i-1}/V_i}\]
and by the discussion of tensor products, 
\[\Phi_{V\otimes W}=\Phi_V\Phi_W.\]

\subsubsection{Illustration: Alternating Powers}
An important example comes from returning to considering $E=\oplus_1^n k\cdot e_i$ on which $\Gamma$ acts naturally. Then if we let 
$V=\bigwedge^r E$, then the character of $V$ is 
\[\Phi_V(X_1,\dots,X_n)=m_{(1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)}(X_i)=X_1\cdots X_r+\cdots\]
since a basis for $V$ are the $r$-fold wedges of distinct $e_i$: $e_{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_r}$ (where we consider only those products that 
are in order of ascending index).

\subsubsection{Characters and Symmetric Functions}
Let $\Sym(n,r)$ be the collection of symmetric functions in $\bbZ[X_1,\dots, X_n]$ that are homogeneous of degree $r$.
Then 
\begin{prop}
	The additive subgroup of $\bbZ[X_i]$ spanned by the $\Phi_V$ for all $V\in M_k(n,r)$ is precisely $\Sym(n,r)$ (and thus is independent of $k$).
\end{prop}
